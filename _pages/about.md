Prior to UM, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Apple and then a Research Scientist at Meta Reality Labs.

During my Ph.D., I had spent wonderful times as a research intern at Adobe Research with [Dr. Oliver Wang](https://oliverwang.nfshost.com/) and Microsoft Research with [Dr. Lu Yuan](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=k9TsUVsAAAAJ&hl=en).


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->

<!-- Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
