I lead the <strong style="font-weight: 900;">Sp</strong>atial <strong style="font-weight: 900;">In</strong>telligent <strong style="font-weight: 900;">S</strong>ystem (<strong style="font-weight: 900;">SPINS</strong>) Lab at University of Manitoba (UM). Prior to UM, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at Apple and then a Research Scientist at Meta Reality Labs. I got my PhD degree from Simon Fraser University in 2020, supervised by [Dr. Ping Tan](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/pingtan). During my PhD, I had spent wonderful times as a research intern at Adobe Research with [Dr. Oliver Wang](https://oliverwang.nfshost.com/) and Microsoft Research with [Dr. Lu Yuan](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=k9TsUVsAAAAJ&hl=en).

My long-term research vision is to solve the `last-centimeter' problem for autonomous intelligent system through an organic integration between visual perception and control. To this end, we have several recent short-term focuses: <strong style="font-weight: 900;">1.</strong> simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for dynamic scenes and systems, <strong style="font-weight: 900;">2.</strong> learning efficient low-level computer vision (stereo, optical flow, grouping, etc) model with uncertainty, <strong style="font-weight: 900;">3.</strong> learning visual representation of environment for model predictive control. 

<strong style="font-weight: 900;">Prospective students:</strong> I have two fully funded positions for self-motivated PhD (preferred) and master students for 2025 Fall / 2026 Winter. If you are interested in working with me, please fill out [this application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaWiIy3ukuPdtrmkGm5Th9jo082tSA3MfOlKx0q-CuHu4g4w/viewform). Students from majors other than computer science are also encouraged to apply as long as you have a solid math <strong style="font-weight: 900;">or</strong> programming skill. Depending on the condition of each candidate, I am also open to other research topics relevant to the above focuses.
